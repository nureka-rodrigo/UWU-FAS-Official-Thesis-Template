\section*{APPENDICES}

Appendices house supplementary material that would interrupt the flow of the
main chapters. Typical inclusions are survey instruments, extended tables,
source code excerpts, sample consent forms, or additional figures. Label each
appendix sequentially (Appendix~A, Appendix~B, \dots) and reference them in the
main text. Do not introduce new analysis here; instead, provide artefacts that
support the results.
