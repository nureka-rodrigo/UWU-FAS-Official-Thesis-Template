The abstract should summarise the entire study in a single, self-contained
page. Write one paragraph (150--250 words) that covers the context, problem,
method, key findings, and primary conclusions. Avoid citations, abbreviations
that are not widely recognised, and undefined jargon. Use past tense for
completed work and present tense for statements of fact. Do not include keywords.
